# Monkey-Business-
A local zoo wants to keep track of how many pounds of food each of its three monkeys eat each day during the business days (5 days).  Store the information in a two-dimensional 3x5 array, where each row represents a different monkey and each column represents a different day of the week.  The program should first have the user input the data for each monkey.  Then it should create a report that includes the following information:  Average amount of food eaten for just one day by the whole family of monkeys (function 1). The least amount of food eaten during the week by any one monkey (function 2). The greatest amount of food eaten during the week by any one monkey (function 3). Function 1: For the average amount of food eaten per day by the whole family of monkeys you will need to send the day to search (0-4).  Function 2: For the least amount of food eaten per week by any one monkey, you will need to search the multi-dimensional array and keep track of how much that monkey ate.  Loop through to find the least amount of food eaten.  After finding the monkey that ate the least, return that amount to the main function.  Function 3: This is similar to function 2 except that you are returning the most food eaten during the week.  Loop through each monkey's food intake per week.  Find the monkey that ate the most during the week and return that amount to the main function.
